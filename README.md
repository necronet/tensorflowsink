Follows multiple example that I've found about tensorflow, mostly it will be about very basic techniques that I found to be interesting to try. Starting obviously with [Tensorflow Keras guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras)

## Sink folder organization

- highlevelapi: covers example as the folder specify of basic features of tensorflow using the high level keras api that is provided out of the box.

- lowlevelapi: is a kitchen sink of example that are related to learning the basic fundamentals of tensorflow without the help of any particular high level abstraction.
